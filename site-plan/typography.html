        <p>
            Your business can join more than one chamber of commerce if you have access to multiple organizations. Keep in mind, you'll pay the membership dues for each chamber of commerce you join, which increases your costs. Make sure all the organizations you join align with your interests or needs and provide benefits that make sense for you.
        </p>
        <h4>Colored paragraph example</h4>
        <p class="colored">
            You should join a chamber of commerce that you plan on being actively involved with. Joining a local chamber of commerce is usually best, considering the familiarity with the area you work in, but you can also join national and international chambers.
